# text-adventure-engine
## CSCI-124 Final Project - Anders Olsen
A python engine for creating text adventures. Looks for folders prefixed `story_` and for `.toml` files to define the rooms and objects in the game. It stores a database file 

To play: Run the `main.py` file. You enter sentences into the text prompt to journey through the world. You can use the `help` command to learn about the types of actions you can take and `exit` to leave the game at any time. The project will run the first available `story_` folder if only one is found, otherwise it will prompt the user to select the story of their choice.
